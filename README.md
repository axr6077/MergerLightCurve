# MergerLightCurve
Analysis data from [Black Hole X Ray binary evolution](https://github.com/axr6077/Black-Hole-X-ray-binary-Evolution), [BH-Mergers](https://github.com/axr6077/BH-Mergers) and [Particle Trajectory](https://github.com/axr6077/ParticleTrajectory) were combined to simulate the light curve caused due to the gravitational wave generated by merger of two black holes. Kilonovas were studied and the knowledge graph was extended to study BH mergers.
